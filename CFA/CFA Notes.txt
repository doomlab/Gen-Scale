-Reduce residual error (better model fit) -- prediction is closer to reality
-Check TLI,CFI,RMSEA, Modifcation Indices
-UCLA CFA website for cutoff scores
-Factor covariances (how they relate to each other)
-Mod. Ind. - the higher, the bigger the impact on model fit
---if you add path to that additional item, it would improve model fit (not to take it away)
---Theory is important: see if it actually makes sense to add that extra construct
-Check Model plot and Show parameters
-Arrow direction: circle is latent contstructs (unobserved), idea is that the latent PREDICTS how you respond on individual items (observed)
---Cross loadings are okay because two latent constructs can influence how people respond to certain items

Construct =~ Item1 + Item2 + ...

=~ means crossloading
~~ correlation between items (can draw an arrow between them to get a better fit)

Parsimonious is always better (all other things being equal)
